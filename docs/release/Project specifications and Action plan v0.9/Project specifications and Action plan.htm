            <h2>Introduction - Users and uses</h2>
            <p class="in">
                The aim of our project is to create an online presentation program bound to academics and students of the University of Teesside. 
                A presentation (also referred as <em>slideshow</em>) is a set of slides (also referred as <em>transparency</em>) which contains elements such as text, images and charts.
				Slides are presented one after the other to an audience for an instructionnal purpose. 
            </p>
            <p class="in">
                Academics will be able to log in the application, create presentations, manage or edit existing ones, 
				and make them available for students. 
				Students will be able to log in the application, browse through the presentations available for them (according to the course they take part in), 
				preview them within the application and download them as an HTML file.
            </p>
            <h2>Why another presentation program ?</h2>
            <p class="in">
                There is already, among desktop as well as web application, many existing solutions to create presentations
            </p>
            <h3>Desktop full-featured applications</h3>
            <p class="in">
                The most known of those softwares are the desktop ones, such as Microsoft PowerPoint and OpenOffice.org Impress.
                Their particularity is to have a large amount of features (and, coming hands in hands, a large amount of toolbars, menus and sub-menus),
                allowing to customize each and every part of the slides : the transitions between slides, the animations, size, color, shape, inclination, ... of
                the smallest element of the slide.
                <br/>
                They are appropriate to produce professional presentation, corresponding exactly to user's needs and desires. 
                Until now they are the best tools for <i>physical</i> presentations, as they allows to have a <i>presenter view</i>
                of the slideshow on a screen (with comments and slides preview) and the normal view on another media, like a video projector.		
            </p>

            </p><h3>On-line collaborative applications</h3>
            <p class="in">
                More and more web-based office are offering the possibility to create presentations inside a web browser and to store it online.
                Their particularity is to make the presentation available from everywhere in the world, 
				providing the user has an internet access and a web browser.
                It's no more required to have a (heavy) application installed locally, nor to take care of software updates.
                <br/>
                Most of these application features a version control and allows many users to edit the document at the same time in a collaborative way and to present it online, 
                but they are not designed to make an offline presentation : there is now way to have two different views on two different medias.
                <br/>
                They are appropriate to create basic documents with a limited amount of animations/transitions and types of embeddable elements (no video, music).
            </p>

                <a href="medias/google presentation.jpg" title="Screenshot of Google documents Presentation, a popular presentation web application" class="thickbox"><img src="medias/google presentation.jpg"/></a>
            </p><h3>On-line sharing applications</h3>
            <p class="in">
                There is another, less known web-based kind of tool in relation with our project : the presentation sharing platforms.
                They are used to manage and shares collection of slideshows on the web by producing a presentation applet out of an uploaded slideshow (a kind of Flickr).
                <br/>
            </p>
            <p class="img">
                <a href="medias/slideshare.png" title="Screenshot of presentation shared on a blog using Slideshare" class="thickbox"><img src="medias/slideshare.png"/></a>
            </p><h3>Our approach</h3>
            <p class="in">
                Our application can not compete with the number of features of desktop presentation program and our primary goal is not to produce a collaboration tool either.
                <br/>
                We have to design an alternative to traditional tools: 
                allowing users, from everywhere, on any platform, to easily create and share visually attractive presentations.
            </p>
			<h2>Use cases</h2>
			<p class="in">
				We've elaborated a set of scenarios corresponding to main tasks users will be able to achieve with our application.<br />
				Thanks to them, we are going to describe the composition of the <acronym title="Graphical User Interfaces">GUI</acronym> of our application.
				We are also going to introduce its features, classified in three categories (<em>must, should and may</em>) depending of their respective need from an end-user point of view.
			</p>
			<h3>Connection to the application. Academic Point Of View</h3>
			<p class="in">
				Academics access to our application on a subdomain within the intranet of the university (using a dedicated address such as <em>http://<strong>academics.netshows.</strong>tees.ac.uk</em>).
				Our application will provide its own login page despite the fact that it will share its user database with other intranet applications.
			</p>
			<h4>login page</h4>
			<h5>must</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>provide an explanation about the application</li>
				<li>allow academics to log in the application</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>may</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>display a link to a screencast</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Presentations management.</h3>
			<p class="in">
				Once connected, user access the main interface. It is composed of two panels : a treeview of user's presentation and the main panel with a <em>welcome tab</em>.
			</p>			
			<h4>Presentation treeview</h4>
			<p class="in">
				The treeview is comparable to a basic treeview of a file system in a file explorer.
			</p>
			<h5>must</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>expand/collapse (sub)folders as well as presentations</li>
				<li>drag'n drop presentation/subfolder from a folder to another</li>
				<li>right-click on any item to rename it</li>
				<li>right-click on any item to delete it (actually send it to the  recycling bin)</li>
				<li>right-click inside a folder to create a new folder or a new presentation (see <a href="#presentation_creation">presentation creation</a> scenario)</li>
				<li>simple click on a presentation to have its description displayed in a part of the welcome tab</li>
				<li>double click on a presentation/slide to open in a new editor tab (see <a href="#presentation_edition">presentation edition</a>)</li>
				<li>right-click inside a presentation to insert a new slide</li>
				<li>drag'n drop a slide from a presentation to another</li>
				<li>copy/paste a slide from a presentation to another</li>
				<li>clone/paste a slide from a presentation to another (a clone is always identical to the original slide)</li>
				<li>right-click on the recycling bin to empty it</li>
				<li>right-click on any item in the recycling bin to definitely delete it</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>should</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>enter key words in a search-field to filter the displayed presentations</li>
				<li>use keyboard to perform previously mentioned actions</li>
				<li>select multiple items to perform previously mentioned actions</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>may</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>use multiple tags instead of folder to classify and filter presentations</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>welcome tab</h4>
			<h5>must</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Display a welcome message : )</li>
				<li>Inform the user about what he can do with the application</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>should</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>display a tip of the day</li>
				<li>display a link to a FAQ list</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>may</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>display a link to a screencast</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="presentation_creation">Presentation creation</h3>
			<p class="in">
				<i>the user choose a template and a default layout, then he/she access to the presentation edition with a first empty slide.</i>
			</p>
			<h3 id="presentation_edition">Presentation edition</h3>
			<p class="in">
				After double-clicking on a presentation or a slide, the treeview is replaced by a vertical thumbnail list of the slides;
				a new editor tab is opened in the main panel to edit the presentation.
				If it's a slide that has been opened, then it is displayed inside the tab, otherwise the first slide of the presentation is displayed.
			</p>
			<h4>thumbnail list</h4>
			<h5>must</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>update the thumbnail as the user edit the slide in the editor tab</li>
				<li>allow all the action possible inside a presentation in the treeview</li>
				<li>right-click to import a set of slides from another presentation</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>editor tab</h4>
			<p class="in">
				To create a slide, the user choose the layout of the slide (by default: one title, one column).
				Then he edit the default text included in the template - using the <em>text toolbar</em> -; add elements (tables, images, shapes, ...) to arbitrary position in the slide - using the <em>insert toolbar</em> -;
				choose transition after which the slide appears and animations of the different elements - using the toolbar on the right.
			</p>
			<h5>must</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>use the edit toolbar to edit text with features of a basic desktop text editor such as WordPad</li>
				<li>use the insert toolbar and the slide itself to insert and modify depth of elements such as text, tables, images, charts</li>
				<li>use the insert toolbar to insert mathematical expression either in LaTex or MathML, converted to an image</li>
				<li>use the toolbar on the right to modify the layout of the slide</li>
				<li>use the toolbar on the right to choose a transition for the slide</li>
				<li>use the toolbar on the right to add animations to element (and choose whether it will start after a delay or a click)</li>
				<li>undo/redo every modification of the slide</li>
				<li>hide/show the toolbar on the right</li>
				<li>resize/move elements directly on the slide</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>should</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>allow to edit a master slide which define the global style and layout.</li>
				<li>allow insertion and manipulation of other element such as audio file, video, applets, quizzes, ...</li>
				<li>switch back to a previous revision of the element/slide/presentation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>may</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>allow to rotate elements</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Publication</h3>
			<p class="in">
				Once finished, the presentation may be made available to public or downloaded directly from the treeview.
			</p>
			<h5>must</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>right click on a presentation and check <em>available to students</em> button</li>
				<li>right click on a presentation and dowload it as a standalone HTML presentation</li>				
			</ul>
			<h5>may</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>right click on a presentation and generate few lines of html code to embed the presentation within a web page (like a youtube video)</li>
				<li>right click on a presentation and check <em>available to unregistered users</em> button</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Connection to the application. Public Point Of View</h3>
			<p class="in">
				Students access to our application on a subdomain within the intranet of the university (through an address such as <em>http://netshows.tees.ac.uk</em>).
				There is also a login page for students in order to know which course they can access.
			</p>
			<h4>login page</h4>
			<h5>must</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>provide an explanation of the application</li>
				<li>allow students to log in the application</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>may</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>display a link to a screencast</li>
				<li>allow unregistered users to access to some parts of some presentations</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Presentations browsing</h3>
			<p class="in">
				Once connected, students access to the kiosk. It looks like the main page of academics: 
				a treeview of all presentation, sorted by course, on which user has <i>read right</i> (he takes part of the course) in the left panel;
				and a main panel with a welcome tab.
			</p>
			<h4>Treeview</h4>
			<h5>must</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>double click on a presentation to preview it in a new tab</li>
				<li>right click on a presentation and download it as a standalone application</li>
			</ul>
