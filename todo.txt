##### Think about ######
- Text description on objects (screen reader)
- Icorporate a widget such as flickr but for the university multimedia database + sounds
- Make a fake lecture of any subject to take the place of academics and students
- Separation between editing, lecture and students
- Integrate users own script or html
- Integrate sounds and video with a universal player
